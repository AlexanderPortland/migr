*DONE* Ridge(19:57 on 2-12-2023).pkl
	- good, but the best alpha value was the highest one tested, so
	  succeeded by Ridge(20:30 on 2-12-2023).pkl which checked up
	  to 10,000 alpha

*DIED* RandomForestRegressor(20:08 on 2-12-2023)
	- first RF model post-preprocessing error fix
	- looked underwhelming but still on max_depth of 1, so i hope
	  it'll get much more effective with more depth and features
	- died prematurely bc of concurrent kernel issues at depth 3
	  and features 0.2, so still hard to tell.
		- will try again but not overly expectant

*DONE* Ridge(20:30 on 2-12-2023)
	- succeeding Ridge(19:57 on 2-12-2023) with a wider array of
	  tested alphas 
	- new best alpha value is second highest, so looks good
		* if wanted to, could redo with more fine-tuned
		  options between the two to further optimize

*IN PROGRESS (dev5)* RandomForestRegressor(1:01 on 3-12-2023)
	- succeeding RandomForestRegressor(20:08 on 2-12-2023), this 
	  algorithm trained overnight to check higher max_layers and
	  feature counts.
		- is taking a long time to train (~1hr per param combo)
		  for no apparent boost in effectiveness over the faster
		  linear models
